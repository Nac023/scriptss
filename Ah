without giving credits to me, and making people go through many ads to get it
or even making it paid, but whole time its free, make sure you get it from the source!
Where to buy: https://www.tech-brain.net/product-page/shinobi-life-2-infinite-spinning
List of bloodlines and stuff is in the channel named #scripts-and-website, and many
other steps on how to use the script correctly Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8KqTZVcfCP

Slot2 = false,

TYPE = true,--Make this true for it to spin for bloodlines/genkais, or make it false to make it spin for elements
ExactName = false,--If you put "sharingan" in Wanted, it will think it can be the sharingan or itachisharingan, or obitosharingan, or sasukesharingan
--So you can put itachi though cause other genkais dont have itachi in their name,
--So yea there's also a genkai named sharingan, now how to get that specifically?
--Just make ExactName = true, simple right, but after that you cant put itachi to get itachisharingan,
--you'd have to put full name itachisharingan, but you can always make ExactName true or false
-- The list of the names to put in Wanted can be found in the discord, always updated.
